\chapter{Homological Algebra}
This chapter serves as an introduction to the rudiments of \emph{homological algebra}, which roughly speaking, is a tool for proving nonconstructive existence theorems. A more extensive treatment can be found in the classics \cite{weibel:homological_algebra:1994} and \cite{rotman:homological_algebra:2009}. However, we mainly follow the exposition provided in \cite{grillet:abstract_algebra:2007}.
