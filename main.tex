\chapter*{Preface}
The process of writing this book started in autumn of 2017. The book is mainly based on the course notes of the course \emph{Algebraic Topology I} and \emph{Algebraic Topology II} held by \emph{Will J. Merry} at \emph{ETH Zurich} in the autumn semester 2017 and spring semester 2018, I visited. They can be found here:

\end{center}
Also, a large inspiration was the course \emph{Introduction to Category Theory and its Applications} held by \emph{Alessandro Valentino} at \emph{University of Zurich} in the autumn of 2017, as well as \emph{A first Course in Homotopy Theory} held by \emph{Vincent Sebastian Braunack-Mayer} at \emph{University of Zurich} in the spring of 2018. Moreover, some further applications of cohomology theory steem from the course \emph{Lie Groups and Lie Algebras} held by \emph{Pavel Safronov} at \emph{University of Zurich} in the spring 2018, I also took.\\

%	Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a_{kj} \in \mathbb{C}$ for $k = 0,\dots,n + 1$, $j = 0,\dots,n$. Show that
%	\begin{equation*}
%		\sum_{k = 0}^{n+1}\sum_{j = 0}^n a_{kj} = \sum_{0 \leq k \leq j \leq n}a_{kj} + \sum_{0 \leq j < k \leq n+1} a_{kj}.
