\subsection*{The Homology Functor}
\begin{definition}[Singular Homology Functor]
	Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. The composition 
	\begin{equation}
		H_n \circ C_\bullet : \mathsf{Top} \to \mathsf{AbGrp}
	\end{equation}
	\noindent of the singular chain complex functor $C_\bullet$ in theorem \ref{thm:singular_complex} and the $n$-th homology functor of proposition \ref{prop:homology_functor} is called the \bld{$n$-th singular homology functor}, written $H^{\mathrm{sing}}_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	For notational purposes we will often refer to the functor $H_n^{\mathrm{sing}}$ simply as $H_n$.

\subsection*{Relative Homology}

\begin{proposition}
	There is a functor $\mathsf{Top}^2 \to \mathsf{Comp}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $(X,A) \in \ob(\mathsf{Top}^2)$. Then we have an inclusion $\iota : A \hookrightarrow X$. Moreover, we have that $C_n(\iota)$ is injective for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Indeed, this is obvious for $n < 0$ and for $n \geq 0$, suppose that $\sum_k m_k \sigma_k \in \ker C_n(\iota)$, where the $\sigma_k$ are distinct. Then we have that $0 = C_n(\iota)\del[1]{\sum_k m_k \sigma_k} = \sum_k m_k \iota \circ \sigma_k$, where the $\iota \circ \sigma_k$ are also distinct. Thus we conclude $\sum_k m_k \sigma_k = 0$. Hence we can see $C_\bullet(A)$ as a subcomplex of $C_\bullet(X)$ and so we can define
	\begin{equation*}
		C_\bullet(X,A) := C_\bullet(X)/C_\bullet(A).
	\end{equation*}
	Moreover, on morphsisms $f \in \mathsf{Top}^2\del[1]{(X,A),(Y,B)}$ just let $C_\bullet(f)$ be the induced map.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Relative Homology Functor]
	For $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the functor 
	\begin{equation}
		H_n \circ C_\bullet : \mathsf{Top}^2 \to \mathsf{AbGrp}
	\end{equation}
	\noindent is called the \bld{$n$-th relative singular homology functor.}
\end{definition}
